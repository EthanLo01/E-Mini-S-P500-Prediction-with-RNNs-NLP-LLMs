The Dec. 24 letter \"Lack of Absolute Proof on Warming\" from Doug Chapman contains an error. The role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has nothing at all to do with their molecular weights. What makes a greenhouse gas function in the role of warming the atmosphere is its ability to absorb infrared radiation, and this depends on the molecular vibrations of the molecule that allow the molecules to absorb and re-emit incident radiation. Carbon dioxide (molecular weight 44) is heavier than nitrogen (28) or oxygen (32), and those are the major gaseous components of the atmosphere, as Mr. Chapman rightly points out, but the lighter gases, water (18) or methane (16), also found in the atmosphere, are very much stronger infrared absorbers by virtue of their OH and CH chemical bonds, respectively. Methane is increasing slowly but carbon dioxide is still in greater concentration in the atmosphere and is more under control of mankind than methane (which results mainly from anaerobic decomposition of organic matter), hence that is where our focus should be in any argument as to what is causing global warming.\n","Too Busy for Their Own Success. \n","Seoul Open to New Ties With North.
